// Package go-xrouter is a trie based HTTP request router.
//
// Its implementation is based on 'github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter' package,
// but you can delete an existing handler without creating a new route. I think
// it's useful in some scenarios which you want to  modify route dynamically.
package xrouter

	"net/http"
)

// XHandle is a function that can be registered to a route to handle HTTP
// requests. Like http.HandleFunc, but has a third parameter for the values
// of wildcards.
type XHandle func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, XParams)

// XParam is a key-value pair representing a single URL parameter.
type XParam struct {
	Key   string
	Value string

// XParams is a XParam-Slice, which returned by the XRouter.
// The slice is ordered so you can safely read values by the index.
type XParams []XParam

// Get function returns the value of the first XParam which key matches the
// given name. If no matching XParam is found, it returns an empty string.
//
// NOTE: The length of XParams is small in most cases, so linear search is
// enough regarding efficiency.
